## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 6+, or MSVC 2017+)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code, CLion, Dev-C++, etc.)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

### Compilation Instructions

Each example can be compiled individually:

```bash
# For single file compilation
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra filename.cpp -o output

# For files with multiple dependencies
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra *.cpp -o output

# With debugging information
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -g filename.cpp -o output
```

### Running Examples

```bash
# Navigate to specific topic folder
cd basics/variables_datatypes/

# Compile and run
g++ -std=c++17 variables_example.cpp -o variables_example
./variables_example
```

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse by Topic**: Navigate to folders based on the concept you want to learn
