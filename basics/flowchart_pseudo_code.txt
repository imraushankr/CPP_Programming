# Flowchart & Pseudo Code Complete Guide

## Introduction

Flowchart and Pseudo Code are essential tools in programming for planning and designing algorithms before writing actual code. They help in visualizing the logic and flow of a program.

**What is a Flowchart?**
A picture that shows how a program works step by step using shapes and arrows.

**What is Pseudo Code?**
Writing program steps in simple English before actual coding.

**Why Use Them?**
- Plan before coding 📝
- See program flow clearly 👀  
- Share ideas easily 💬
- Find errors quickly 🐛
- Make complex things simple 🧩

## Flowchart Symbols & Instructions

### Basic Flowchart Symbols:
1. **🥚 OVAL (Terminal)** - Start/End of the program
2. **📦 RECTANGLE (Process)** - General processing steps, calculations, and operations
3. **💎 DIAMOND (Decision)** - Conditional statements and branching (Yes/No questions)
4. **📄 PARALLELOGRAM (Input/Output)** - Get data or show results
5. **➡️ ARROW** - Direction of flow
6. **⭕ CIRCLE (Connector)** - Connect parts when needed

### Flowchart Design Rules:
- Start with START oval 🏁
- End with END oval 🏁
- Use appropriate shapes for each operation ✅
- Maintain flow direction (top to bottom, left to right) ⬇️
- Clear decision points with Yes/No branches ✔️❌
- Avoid crossing lines 🚫
- Keep shapes same size 📏
- Use clear labels 🏷️

## Pseudo Code Writing Rules

### Structure and Keywords:
**📥 READ/INPUT** - Get data from user
**📤 PRINT/OUTPUT** - Show results  
**🔀 IF/ELSE/ENDIF** - Make decisions
**🔄 WHILE/ENDWHILE** - Repeat with condition
**🔢 FOR/ENDFOR** - Repeat with counter
**🏁 BEGIN/END** - Start/Stop program

### Writing Guidelines:
1. **Use simple English** statements
2. **Maintain logical sequence**
3. **Indent nested structures** 📝
4. **Use standard keywords**
5. **Use good variable names** 🏷️
6. **Keep it readable** 👀

## Control Structures

### 1️⃣ Sequential Processing
Instructions executed one after another
**Pattern:** Input → Process → Output

### 2️⃣ Decision Making  
Conditional statements (if/else)
**Pattern:** Input → Decision → Multiple Paths → Output
- Diamond shape in flowcharts
- Boolean conditions (true/false)

### 3️⃣ Looping/Iteration
Repetitive execution
**Pattern:** Input → Loop → Process → Output

#### Loop Types:
**🔢 FOR LOOP:** Know how many times to repeat
```
FOR i = 1 TO 10
```

**⚡ WHILE LOOP:** Check condition first, then repeat  
```
WHILE condition is true
```

**🔁 REPEAT-UNTIL LOOP:** Do first, then check condition
```
REPEAT steps UNTIL condition
```

## Problem-Solving Steps

### 6-Step Approach to Programming:
1. **Understand Problem** - Analyze what needs to be solved
2. **Given Values** - Identify input parameters  
3. **Approach** - Plan the solution strategy
4. **Code** - Write the actual program
5. **Error/Debug** - Test and fix issues
6. **Other Solution** - Consider alternative approaches

### Algorithm Development Process:
1. **Problem Analysis**: Understand requirements
2. **Input Identification**: What data is needed?
3. **Output Planning**: What should be produced?
4. **Logic Design**: How to process input to get output?
5. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**: Detailed instructions
6. **Testing**: Verify with sample data

## Programming Examples

### Example 1: Sum of Two Numbers

**Pseudo Code:**
```
1. Read a, b
2. ans = a + b  
3. print ans
```

**Flowchart Steps:**
```
Start
  ↓
Read a, b
  ↓
ans = a + b
  ↓
Print ans
  ↓
End
```

### Example 2: Subtraction of Two Numbers

**Pseudo Code:**
```
1. Read a, b
2. ans = a - b
3. print ans
```

**Flowchart Steps:**
```
Start
  ↓
Read a, b  
  ↓
ans = a - b
  ↓
Print ans
  ↓
End
```

### Example 3: Check Even or Odd Number

**Pseudo Code:**
```
Start
  ↓
Read num
  ↓
Is num % 2 == 0?
  ↓         ↓
 Yes       No
  ↓         ↓
Print     Print
"Even"    "Odd"
  ↓         ↓
End       End
```

**Decision Logic:**
- **If (num % 2 == 0)** → Print "Even"
- **Else** → Print "Odd"

### Example 4: Check if Number is Prime

**Pseudo Code:**
```
Start
  ↓
Read num, n
  ↓
count = 1
  ↓
Is count <= n?
  ↓      ↓
 Yes    No
  ↓      ↓
Is n % count == 0?  → End
  ↓      ↓
 Yes    No
  ↓      ↓
Print  count = count + 1
"Not     ↓
Prime"  Loop back to condition
  ↓
End
```

**Prime Number Logic:**
- **Loop**: from count = 1 to n
- **Check**: if n % count == 0
- **If divisible**: Print "Not Prime"
- **Algorithm**: Check divisibility for all numbers from 1 to n

### Example 5: Sum of N Natural Numbers

**Pseudo Code:**
```
Start
  ↓
Read num, n
  ↓
count = 1
sum = 0
  ↓
Is count <= n?
  ↓      ↓
 Yes    No
  ↓      ↓
sum = sum + count  Print sum
count = count + 1    ↓
  ↓               End
Loop back to condition
```

**Logic Explanation:**
- **Initialize**: count = 1, sum = 0
- **Loop**: while count <= n
- **Process**: sum = sum + count, count = count + 1
- **Output**: Print final sum
